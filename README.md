This is the website we made to create a centralized platform that makes it easy for philanthropists to discover and support NGOs working in areas they are passionate about.

We have used MERN(Mongo ds, Express, React js, Node js) stack for approaching this problem. For front end we have used React js which is a client-side JavaScript framework, for backend we have used node js which is a premier JavaScript web server and Express js, which is a Node.js web framework and finally used MongoDb as a database

As a result this web page covered most of the functionality listed in the Problems Statement that include information about their previous works, their end goal, and their plans as to how they can achieve their goal.

We have also implemented Search and filter functionality which makes the Philanthropist job a bit easier. Also suggestion algorithms are used to categorise NGO's based on philanthropic needs. Also our webpage includes mechanisms for the users tocommunicate with different NGOs(text message, video meeting, etc.) using zegocloud
